# How to Connect Your Portfolio App to Supabase

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your Supabase backend and connect it to your Next.js portfolio application.

## Step 1: Create a New Supabase Project

1.  Go to the [Supabase website](https://supabase.com/) and log in to your account (or create a new one).
2.  Once logged in, click on "New project".
3.  Choose a name for your project, set a strong database password, select a region, and click "Create new project".
4.  Wait for your project to be provisioned. This may take a few minutes.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Database Schema

Your portfolio application requires specific tables and Row Level Security (RLS) policies to function correctly. These are defined in the `supabase/schema.sql` file within your project.

1.  In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to the "SQL Editor" (usually found in the left sidebar).
2.  Open the `portfolio-app/supabase/schema.sql` file from your local project.
3.  Copy the entire content of `schema.sql`.
4.  Paste the copied SQL into the editor in your Supabase dashboard.
5.  Click "Run" or "Run query" to execute the SQL commands. This will create all the necessary tables (`profiles`, `skills`, `projects`, `achievements`, `experience`, `education`, `testimonials`, `updates`, `contact_messages`, `media`) and set up their RLS policies and storage buckets.

## Step 3: Retrieve Your Supabase API Keys

To connect your Next.js application to your Supabase project, you need your project's URL and API keys.

1.  In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to "Project Settings" (usually a gear icon in the left sidebar) -> "API".
2.  You will find the following important pieces of information:
    *   **Project URL:** This is your unique Supabase project endpoint (e.g., `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`). Copy this value.
    *   **`anon` (public) key:** This is your client-side Supabase API key. Copy this value.

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables in Your Application

You need to tell your Next.js application where to find your Supabase project.

1.  In the root directory of your `portfolio-app` project, you will find a file named `.env.local.example`.
2.  **Rename** this file to `.env.local`.
3.  Open the newly renamed `.env.local` file in your code editor.
4.  Paste the Project URL and `anon` public key you retrieved in the previous step:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE` with your actual values).

5.  Save the `.env.local` file.

## Step 5: Run Your Application

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the `portfolio-app` directory:
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-app
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. Your application should now be connected to your Supabase project!

## Next Steps: Admin Panel Access

1.  **Create an Admin User:**
    *   For the admin panel to work, you need at least one user registered in your Supabase project.
    *   In your Supabase dashboard, go to "Authentication" -> "Users".
    *   You can "Invite a user" by providing an email and password. This user will be able to log into your admin panel.
    *   Alternatively, you can temporarily enable user sign-ups in your Supabase Authentication settings, create a user from the app's login page (`/admin/login`), and then disable sign-ups.
2.  **Log In:**
    *   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/login` in your browser.
    *   Use the credentials of the user you created in Supabase to log in.
    *   You will then be redirected to the admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) where you can start adding your portfolio content!

This concludes the setup process. You can now manage your portfolio content directly from your admin panel!
